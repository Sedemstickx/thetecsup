<p><b class="bold_about">Ease-of-use</b>: With <?php echo $site_title; ?>, users can ask questions with the inclusion of images for making descriptions easier for others to understand. This can make problem solving easier to do if the helper clearly understands the given tech issue.

This also makes getting help easy even for people that aren't technically savvy. We encourage the use of adding images to both questions and replies to make difficulties in the understanding of tech issues and their solutions a thing of the past. </p>

Less code on a page, compression and others are put in place to acheive this.

Uploaded images on the site are also compressed to use less data whiles maintaining image clarity so that a user can see the uploaded image as is supposed to be viewed. listings of some feeds are also limited per page to reduce data too. With this you don't have to worry about your limited data going empty. </p>
